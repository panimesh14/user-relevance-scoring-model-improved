And my answer remains the same: I followed my curiosity.

A big Elizabeth Gilbert fan (and Kaizen fan; and a voracious lover of books in general), I discovered I had a “passion” for Marketing by following my innate curiosity. I asked myself: what could a career based on my love for writing look like? That’s what led me to Copywriting and Social Media at a leading Creative Agency, to Consulting for a Manchester-based marketing science firm, and most recently Product Marketing at an EdTech giant. 

With a Master’s in Marketing from The University of Manchester – ranked #3 in the UK – thrown in for good measure. 

My curiosity has also led me to write for the Harvard Business Review (link in bio) and work as a Content Creator and DEI champion during (and beyond) the LinkedIn Creator Accelerator Program.

At the heart of all my work lies a curiosity and a love for learning. I consider myself a serial devourer of new ideas and an ardent explorer of new ways of solving problems. Oh, and I’m also a poet with an upcoming book of poetry out soon (stay tuned!).",4,4,1,1,1

Being a full-time mother, I have experienced feelings where my self-belief, confidence, and eventually trust in myself took a backseat.

I started seeking validation from others. Little did I know that I was only moving towards a path of self-pity. 

Back in 2020, when I started LinkedIn content creation journey as a content writer, I understood that a career without mental well-being is like a kite without a string; you will stay in one place with no option to spread your wings or fly high in the sky. 

To give it back, I began my journey as a creator who talks about overall well-being. I understand how it feels to be broken, having no answers about why it is happening and what to do next. But like everyone else, I have bills to pay too. So, to stay within my niche, I would love to connect with:

I built Dr. Vaidya’s to India’s largest Ayurveda brand online and took it to an acquisition. I now lead venture investing for Verlinvest through a new fund called V3 Ventures. 

I'm also actively angel investor and mentor to brands in India’s startup ecosystem. If you’re an early-stage founder DM me - I'm happy to chat!

Here's my story:

‘Vaidya’ my last name means Ayurvedic doctor and I come from 150 years of Ayurveda legacy. I grew up with asthma and after 14 years of treatment, I was cured. More than just being a family legacy, I became a believer in the potential of the science and so I promised him I’d take forward this legacy.

In 2009, I went to Brown University for my undergrad. I witnessed the natural and organic products revolution there. I also saw yoga become a multibillion-dollar industry with a repackaged identity for modern consumers. This made me think about the opportunity we had with Ayurveda…

In 2013, I moved back to India and joined a consumer sector focused growth private equity fund called L Catterton. Here, I spent time understanding and investing in the Indian consumer story. I was also fortunate to see the advent of e-commerce in India closely.

In this time, my grandfather passed and so, I decided to action the promise I had made him. 

In October 2016, I quit my job to take on my family’s Ayurveda legacy. Dr. Vaidya’s repackaged the ancient Indian science of Ayurveda for modern consumers and emerged as India’s largest Ayurveda brand online. In 4 years, we successfully reached 2m+ consumers across 16,500+ pin codes in India and launched 80+ products and clocked 5,000+ orders per day!

I was the first Ayurvedic Entrepreneur to be featured in the Forbes 30 Under 30 Asia List for and Business World 40 Under 40 List! We also won Youth SMB of the Year from Amazon and the Retail Startup Award from the Retailers Association of India. In June 2019, we partnered with the USD 4b RP Sanjiv Goenka Group and led the business to an acquisition by the group – making it one of India’s first successful D2C exits. 

Post the exit, I have become an active early stage investor (through V3 Ventures and as an angel). 
 
Outside work, I’m a World Economic Forum Global Shaper and a part Brown University’s Young Alumni Advisory Council. I also run a podcast called Direct to a Billion Consumers on navigating India’s complex and exciting FMCG ecosystem. Check it out here: https://campsite.bio/d2bc",1,1,2,1,0

About Connect Solutions...Recruitment Made Easy --

Job portals are changing the way job search and hiring use to happen. Today, job
seekers can find career opportunities at their own comfort. Job seekers can use online
job sites to find professions that best fit their dream career.
Most of the Job portals are simply pushing recruiters with dormant or active candidates
and many a times, candidates may not even remember that s/he even applied for the
job.
Most of the platforms are merely giving candidates and recruiters an opportunity to
locate each other like particles of dust in a desert. They simply allow firms to post their
job vacancies and dump the candidate’s data.
Today, automation is changing the way we work, streamlining processes that once
required only human interaction. Recruitment is a critical process of any organization;
big or small. Having the right set of talent helps achieve the desired objective; still many
companies are finding it increasingly difficult to source and recruit the right kind of talent
in this increasingly competitive market.
With the advent of Connect Solutions, companies can think and plan automating their entire
recruitment process that will facilitate their team to be more efficient, can streamline
certain repetitive processes and reduce time and cost considerably.
Connect Solutions a pre-hiring job assessment portal, initiative of Panacea eBiz Consulting Group,
has stepped towards AUTOMATING RECRUITMENT, which will help industries at large
to save time and money on application management and shortlisting of candidates
besides making their recruitment perfect fit through assessment process for each
candidate.
 will help candidates to apply and take the job process and qualify the process
without actually visiting the company and saving the embarrassment, in case of being
rejected on some basic parameters.
Connect Solutions helps candidates to apply or take up Job as set by the recruiter. They get to
know what the recruiter is expecting from them by going through a set assessment
process. They can search Job based on their individual sectorial requirements, right
from the beginning. They get qualified first and step into the office later.
Connect Solutions, like other job portals, doesn’t push candidate’s data to any recruiter but intimate
candidates for the same.I",20,5,0,1,5

Thanks for showing interest in my profile! 😇
Want to know a little bit about myself? Have a look then👇🏻

It was 2017 when I decided to come to Bangalore to do an MBA. It was one of the bad-ass decisions I have taken in my life (as I took so many 😅). After falling out of love with Computer Science (my B.Tech stream), I chose to do MBA in Marketing. While doing my MBA, I found my sole interest in Digital Marketing. From that time only, I started doing courses in Digital Marketing. For my extreme introvert and shy nature, I took a lot of time to find a proper career path for myself. After completing my MBA in 2019, I got a job as a Presales Executive in an IT company, from my campus placement. I stuck there for good three years as I lacked self-confidence and clarity about my career. Finally, when I decided to move out and restart my career in my true interest, I joined a company as a Social Media Executive. After working there for 3 months, I decided to take a step towards my goal and started freelancing full-time.

I started freelancing as a Content writer in 2020 and eventually expanded my services in Social Media Marketing at the beginning of 2021. I worked with 25+ clients in different niches till now.  

I have also consulted 10+ businesses so far for Instagram, Facebook & LinkedIn strategies. Please check out my website to know more about me & my services.

I'm Yash. I'm an engineer and also a Master's in Biology. But never did find them interesting. Funny story. 

I've always been interested in tech though and found my calling in tech products. I love understanding the user psychology involved in products. 

Previously worked on my startup Relife, helping people build healthy habits through a motivated community. Think Strava, but for all your habits! Launched the app, got 100+ users and 15+ paying users - until we realised that it wasn't working out and decided to shut it. Before that worked as a product manager, but the role's been getting too much lime light lately. So I'll skip the details.

Currently building topmate. It lets you create your personal link where your followers can schedule your time for 1:1 guidance and mentoring. It's all pretty seamless - scheduling, payments, rescheduling, reminders and more. All without sharing your info! If your audience keep requesting you for guidance, do try it out - you'll love it!

I come from a small city in Kerala. After finishing my Masters in English Language and Literature from a not-so-fancy institution, I aimed to work as an English Language Trainer in my dream organisation at the time- British Council. But, I didn't have any connections in high places to get me in and my extended family even warned me that I was aiming too high, and to settle for a role as a Teacher in a primary school or a college in my hometown.😔

🔥Long story short, I got admitted into a Cambridge University certified teacher training program and eventually my dream organisation, all in less than 6 months after completing my Master's. I believe the reason for these life-changing opportunities has got a lot to do with the resumes I wrote, which convinced the recruiters to get to know me.

I was not a digital marketer back in 2007, when I started my career.

I worked a 9-5 job as a techie.

As part of IBM's North American customer support team, I was responsible for providing technical support.

A 360 degree turn in life forced me to make a decision that took me away from my 9-5 job.

As I continued to write, I jumped right in. As a result of my curiosity, I started exploring digital marketing.

In the last 12 years+, I have shaped my career from a content writer to a full-stack digital marketer. 

From a start-up to an acquisition by Reliance Industries, I worked on several businesses.

Besides working on the online presence of my clients, I've also taken steps to build my own online community.

From LinkedIn, In past 18 months I have

-> Built a network of 22,000 people on Linkedin
-> Made 50 lakh+ in revenue [retainer clients]
-> Conducting expert digital marketing sessions on the forum of upGrad & others as industry experts

Where am I from?
Mumbai, India. Often referred to as the city that never sleeps. I, however, get my eight hours every night. 

My journey in a nutshell? 

I've always been a class topper in school and college. I never enjoyed physics, and arts was not considered an option if you got good grades at that time, and so I 'chose' commerce. Once that decision was made, the only option in front of me with my grades was Chartered Accountancy. I cleared all the papers I sat for but luckily realised early on that it wasnt the career for me. So, I walked off. No regrets. Met some of my closest friends through that journey and earned some accounting and tax knowledge that comes in handy today. 

As a result, I started working full time at 19, alongside my studies. I graduated among the top 10 in Mumbai University while working in a Public Relations start up for 2.5 years on projects such as A R Rahman, Swedish House Mafia and many more that were a teenager's dream. Once I left, I worked with a social media firm for a few months and was soon leading their most important projects. Even after being offered early promotions, I didn't think it was the right next step for me. The decision to study further stemmed from there and I pursued and ranked among the top 3 in my Masters in International Business program in Singapore. 

The global exposure broadened my horizons and I wanted more. I worked very hard to find myself a job in France and Sociabble happened. After a good performance selling to the European market, I felt the itch to take this to my own home. I built a case and was permitted to start Sociabble's first Asia office to service this side of the world. Back then it was just me and my laptop and it feels surreal to see the clientele and team we've now built here today. 

While building Sociabble, I also continued to build myself as a multi-passionate professional. I wrote - on social, short stories and now a novel; I advocated for women at work in India; I studied to become a coach and launched my business.

So what do I do today? 

I am the Director of Sociabble, Asia. As pioneers in employee advocacy and employee communication, I have grown to know this industry inside-out. 

I am an ICF certified career and life coach with the goal to help as many people as I can experience the same benefits I have by chasing their dreams - Butterfly Effect Coaching.

At the purest level, I am a writer and now a creator and author.

I don’t like to raise extra high pitches but here are some quick nuggets of my journey till now 👇

📒I started as a networking geek in Telecom industry but my desire to be a business leader and my strength of communicating with people and getting to know their thoughts and ideas brought me here.
📒I prepared and successfully landed as a Business Analyst/Business Consultant in Big4. 
📒I connected with a lot of like-minded folks in this journey and tried to help them to pursue the same path. This sparked a keen interest in me to create more content on Business Analysis and make it an easy approach for others.
📒As it's rightly said ""Learning never stops"", my fascination started to grow more towards product side of business and I triggered it with a bunch of good Product learnings and inspirations derived from great Product Leaders.
📒And here I am now, working as a Product Owner and applying all my skills at its best to pursue my dream.

🚀I have worked on multiple user acquisition, activation, retention, funnel improvements, growth, and revenue related projects.

🚀I have performed exceptionally well at my current stint as a Product Manager. I am known for solving challenging problems, finding the root cause, laying roadmaps, building innovative and efficient solutions.

🚀I am also popular amongst my peer for my documentation, process optimization, and self-organizing skills.

Product Management has become my love and a passion. I 'enjoy working' rather than just 'only working'.❤️

I love building products by showing high ownership with customer centricity and customer empowerment in focus. I love solving challenging problems! 🔥

✨ The story behind choosing Product Management as a career:

I am a Mechanical Engineer by degree but an actual engineer at heart as problem-solving comes naturally to me. 

⚡I participated in my first competition as a 16 y/o. I submitted an idea for a GOI innovation competition. Idea: To switch off the lights of a room with a doormat when someone would remove their shoes from it. I saw the usage of an LDR (Light Dependent Resistance) sensor at an innovation competition and thought of using the same sensor to switch off the lights. 

⚡Used the same concept in my first year of engineering to build a bus window safety system (spent only Rs.80) for school children -. to prevent taking out of their hands. Ended up winning more than 7 competitions. Even got recognition from a well-known Doctor of Punjab in a National Level competition. That's when I realized the power of solving customer problems after understanding their needs. 

🌟 Nothing stopped me after this. Filed 12 patents, innovated 11 projects, and got recognitions at various International and National level competitions. Led various student clubs, participated in various activities and did not stop learning!

🌟 Was recognized as an outstanding student in the college. I learnt mostly outside the class, graduated and made it to the top 10 list.

🌟 This is how my love for Product Management started. 

✨ About me: 
I am a dog lover. I love traveling, exploring nature, and unfolding the truths of human existence. I am here to leave an impact and bring a change in the society.

I am always learning, exploring, and taking challenges.

On the very 1st day of career, I went to meet HOD. He welcomed me. Then he pointed out one object hanging on a wall and asked me. What is it?? I replied, Sir, it is poster having a drawing of a diamond. He was not convinced. He again asked me, What is it?? I thought for a while and I replied the same answer.

Then he answered, it is not just a diamond. It is a ""POLISHED DIAMOND"". Higher the number of polished faces it has, Higher would be the value 💰of it and brighter it will be among its category. These words became the major motivation of my life on the first day of my careers.

Alright, let's talk some professional stuff now.

👉My career started with Accenture where I worked on software testing for multiple projects, including a merger scenario. The time there significantly improved my team working and observational skills. 
 	
👉Currently, an MBA student in Marketing at IMT Ghaziabad and I carried out my MBA internship at Ascent Health where I delivered more than 100% of the target mark 6 times over the course of two months.

👉The numbers were a result of the performed in-depth analysis of 9000+ retailers to create multiple segments based on their purchasing behaviour across categories.

Ok, here's the interesting part.

For the past 1 year, I have been sharing insights about marketing, FMCG and building business.

Now, there can only be two reasons for not getting interviews:
1. Your résumé shows you're an unfit candidate 
2. You're ACTUALLY an unfit candidate 

Most jobseekers fall in the first category.

Even if you're exceptional at what you do, recruiters are NOT CONFIDENT you can take on the job's responsibilities.

Heck, they even have no idea who you are, or what you bring to the table. 

Your first impression is WEAK

As a result, you're wasting precious time calling everyone you know and almost begging for a job, applying to hundreds of jobs and getting rejected or worse, getting ghosted. 

Every time your phone rings, every time you get a notification, you're anticipating some company somewhere is FINALLY giving you a chance.

Every company that doesn't contact you, has by default, REJECTED you.
Every day you're not working, you're losing money. 

Best case scenario – you get a couple of referrals by relatives or connections in unknown companies, for roles that don't suit you or your experience, AND for salaries that SUCK.

But you're DESPERATE at this point. ANYTHING will do.

Now, imagine getting so many interview calls, that you have to put your phone on silent to get a moment of peace.

You have so many offers in hand, YOU get to negotiate your salary on YOUR terms.

YOU get to reject THEM.

You are now the one in control. 

You are in a position of POWER.

“How the hell am I going to get to that stage?”, I hear you asking.

This is where I come in.

Here's what you'll get:

-A complete résumé rewrite and reformat FROM SCRATCH done according to the legendary recruiters at IBM, Google, Apple, Netflix, and Amazon, using my CUSTOM template that passes EVERY SINGLE ATS SCREENING IN EXISTENCE. 

-A cover letter guide with HANDHOLDING prompts that answers ANY QUESTIONS a recruiter may have about your career.

-A LinkedIn profile revamp guide made SPECIFICALLY for jobseekers.

-Guides on how to handle face-to-face and phone interviews like a PRO.

-An elevator pitch guide to help you pitch perfectly your candidature to recruiters IN PERSON, for that cherry on top, COMPLETE, 100% level of preparation.

NOTHING, is left out, and there are ZERO upsells.

Let's make it happen.

Send me a message.

PS: My process will make you 100% INDEPENDENT of résumé writers once you've worked with me.
About 90% of your current résumé will be thrown out of the window. I don't repurpose your existing content and scam you like other résumé writers. If the existing content worked, you wouldn't need me.",1,2,2,1,0

I studied Electrical Engineering in the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, and it opened me up to a new world of possibilities. In my University days, I was exposed to C Programming, where I learnt the fundamentals of Programming, and became the best in the C Programming class of 2015. But I still yearned to learn more; to learn something different.

And it happened that in August 2015, the Institute of Electrical Electronics Engineering (IEEE), a body regulating Electrical and Electrical Engineering globally, held a web development class for passionate student members. I maximized that opportunity to learn HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, MySQL and PHP. I even began to help most of our final year students with their project using my knowledge of web development.

But that was hardly enough to fuel my passion for programming. In 2017, I worked on a seminar topic about remote controlled home using Raspberry PI, where I had my first hands-on with Python programming language. Since then, it has been impossible to get enough. Web development, using Python-Django, speaks to all my passions; it incorporates the creativity and problem-solving techniques I desire, and allows me to improve the codes (in a separate Git branch, of course) using Circle CI for CI/CD.

I love applying responsive design principles and working with Reactjs and Context API as state manager.

● My fist job was as a Tax Accountant and then I completely changed my life by moving to France and pursuing a Data Science career.
● At 18 I went alone to United States with only 80$ in my pocket and came back home with 10.000, after having worked on 2 jobs during 3 1/2 months.
● This year in January I started prepping for a Powerlifiting meet and after only 9 months I won the silver medal at the National Competition in Bench Press.
These are only a couple of examples to illustrate how I deliver results, how I get 100% invested in anything that I do, how I control my environment to suit my needs, how much goal driven I am.

I have been a Data Scientist for around 6 years now and I think that Data should be leveraged by any company who wants to keep a competitive advantage on a world market abundant in information.
Automation can be found not only in RPA processes or hard coded batches, but also in Machine Learning, and so I started specializing myself on AI platforms, because I know how they can be easily grasped by anyone with the right training approach and the right mindset.

As president of the Lyon Data Science Association I also enjoy getting involved in data communities in my spare time and this is how I learned that not only do I have pretty good technical skills, but also that my biggest assets are the soft skills that people always appreciated at me while working as a data scientist. I am able to use these soft skills so that I can demystify AI and ML concepts, both to hard core developers, and also to decision makers.

This desire to share knowledge has driven me since the beginning to become a data science speaker and promoter, an evangelist and teacher in own time.
I am an AI facilitator, a data enabler and these are strong assets that I like to use with dedication and passion in any activity that I start, whether it is in my professional life or in my personal one.",9,0,0,1,8

She was raised by her grandparents, so a large part of her comes from them. Her values are old school but so complete which gives acceptance to every single being. She moved out of her hometown after completing her 12th grade. She had come to Delhi at 18 years of age and has been staying here since then.

Has it been easy?- Hell, No!
But she truly loves every part of the life she has created for herself here. She had moved to a different world as she entered University of Delhi for her Undergrad and also started CA

She cleared her CA Foundation with decent scores. Soon, she also started taking parts in several events being organised in her college and university. While her fourth semester ended she had also cleared her both groups of CA Intermediate with 6/8 exemptions

Till that time she had  also done multiple internships and been in a leadership position in various college societies. She also became the President of one of the leading NGOs in India- Vishalakshi Foundation at her college level

After her CA Intermediate, she started interning with Transform careers where she learnt handling multiple tasks at the same time. Soon after she started interning with CA Aishwary Gupta (a famous face of Polygon) in Blockchain content creation which helped her learn a lot about Blockchain as she was actively engaged in designing Blockchain courses

She also interned with EDU91, a leading name in CA, ACCA coaching industry and was engaged in writing long form Articles, LinkedIn posts for the founders, Instagram posts which helped her polish her writing skills. She wrote 100+ Articles, 100+ LinkedIn posts in those 6 months

She also on her own started assisting people on LinkedIn to improve their profiles and helped them design their LinkedIn banners, Profile Pictures etc which helped her make decent money for sustaining herself in Delhi

Currently, she has moved one step ahead in her career and is doing Articleship from S.R. Batliboi & Co. LLP (EY) in Assurance. The learning curve for her till now has been really upward sloping. To know what she has done so far, you can refer the description in her experience section below

Being the pioneer member of the Learning & Development team in Directi (Zeta, Radix & Flock) and Razorpay, my interest lies in building the most effective learning culture in a company.
