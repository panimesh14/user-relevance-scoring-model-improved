""I got more clarity on steps to enhance my career path as a product manager, moreover, I also learned what is required to excel in PM interviews. It would be great if you can plan some interview preparation structure that one can follow to land into a PM role."" - Mudita Chauhan

As a small business owner, social worker, counsellor, student and researcher, I help individuals and communities access and improve their mental health. While I work in multiple areas, I base myself philosophically on an interpersonal dialogue between experiential person-centred and psychodynamic perspectives. 

📍 Mental health professionals (MHPs) today are facing multifold challenges, especially wrt the lack of employment, infrastructure and robust policies. Recognising the necessity of MHPs and their challenges, I'm working on solutions to make the lives of MHPs better and to retain the much needed human resource within the discipline. 

📍 As an independent researcher, I'm working on a project studying the mental health workforce in India. Additionally, I'm also involved in research on Relational Trauma in south Asian communities.     

📍 As a PhD aspirant interested in psychotherapy and mental health in the South Asian context, I facilitate weekly accountability meetings for like-minded individuals committed to developing themselves as competent professionals.

📍 I provide mentoring/guidance to MH students who need assistance. If it's not my area of expertise, I can help you find resources. 

📍Always on the lookout for learning from and with fellow humans and collaborating with fellow entrepreneurs and MHPs.

I was top of the class in maths in primary school and after I finished my class 10th with 10 cgpa my teachers and classmates asked me to pursue Science !

But, since ninth grade, I've been certain that the career path I want to take in life is that of a CA, not an engineer or a doctor, as everyone else in my class was doing or considering. So, in class 11th and 12th, I chose COMMERCE as my stream and relished every moment of studying Accountancy, Economics, Business, English, and my favourite MATHEMATICS, yeah, I pursued Commerce with maths and managed to achieve the highest marks in my favourite sub in school ie. mathematics-95

So, today, I'm pursuing my ambition of becoming a chartered accountant. I still enjoy working with numbers and complex data to solve challenges and support business success 

I also have a solid awareness of accounting standards and auditing standards, as well as a thorough understanding of the Companies Act and a basic understanding of income tax and GST regulations, as well as other legislation such as the Contract Act, Soga, and others.

I am proficient in Excel, TallyERP9, Idea, Microsoft Word, and PowerPoint.

I am open to paid collaborations if I feel connected with your brand. So, feel free contact me for the same

CONFIDENT enough to manage any circumstance to the best of my ability; in essence, I may or may not be the best, but I give it my all in every task so that I do not regret it later.

Here is my journey that will help you KNOW me better. 

I am the youngest son of a Baniya Business Class family who chose to become a MECH ENGG and do something different from my 26 cousins (yeah, that huge is the family). 

2 years of engineering job helped me understand what I don't want in life. Working with a 64 years old CEO in your first job can do that. 

2013 - 2018: Period of experimentation with Insurance sales, Direct selling, Meeting new people, Travelling to explore people and business. Fortunately, I met all my MENTORS in this period, some of them are now Billionaires. 
 
2018: A new journey begins to experiment as a Coach and Community Builder.

🚀 THE GOALCHY CLUB COMMUNITY (a support system for my participants) 
🚀 32+ Batches 
🚀 2000+ Participants from 10+ countries. 
🚀 400+ Goals achieved by the participants over a period of 3 years. 

2019: The Content Creation Journey
🚀 If you are reading this, you must be wondering how I got 1.44 lakhs+ followers. No secret, I write one value-adding post every day and engage with 10-15 people each day since 16 March 2019. 

2020: The year of COLLABORATION 
🚀 I met my associate partners and together we created GROWTH HACKING BOOK 2 
🚀 International Bestseller on Amazon 
🚀 Golden Book of World Records Awardee 
🚀 100+ Marketers as contributors in sharing their knowledge 

2021: The year of COLLABORATIONS + GROWTH 
I took another leap to help D2C, WEb3 Startups, and MSMEs with my team's experience in 
🚀 Brand Startegy,
🚀 Marketing Startegy, 
🚀 LinkedIn Training 
🚀 Influencer Marketing 
🚀 Community Building
🚀 Email Marketing (98% inbox landing ratio) 

I and teamwork with brands like INSTAMOJO (we got 15,00,000 views on their content via influencer marketing and made it to the best-performing marketing campaign of the month. 

Mentza (Audio learning app) - 24000 app downloads in 60 days, and also, got a good number of content creators on the platform via email marketing. 

MSMEX.IN and CRATER.CLUB was really nice to onboard me as an expert to serve their consumers.

Let’s get to know me better.

She is an ESG analyst and researcher by profession and a sustainability aficionado at heart.

Her relevant experience includes:
ESG Reporting: BRSR, TCFD, CDP & GRI frameworks
Decarbonization: GHG accounting, Scenario Analysis, Climate Risk assessment, Carbon Credit, Carbon offset & Internal carbon pricing (ICP)

She is a people's person. She provides counselling to students to keep them ahead of the curve. Professionals across the spectrum exchange sustainability-centric insights with her. This keeps her on her toes, thereby updating herself with the dynamic landscape of this industry. Her forte lies in research and analysis. She believes in critically analyzing every bit of information rather than accepting it straightaway. She has experience in publishing her own research paper titled “Anthropogenic Intensification of Flooding and its Disastrous Ramifications on Mumbai”.

One of her goals is to improve ESG literacy in India by making information about sustainability and climate change more accessible to the public.

To accomplish this herculean task, she has taken multiple initiatives. One of them is her podcast Sustainability101  which has exploded in popularity. To complement it further, she organized multiple bootcamps and Workshop-Climate Policy, LCA & latest one ESG. 

In her formative years, football always caught her attention. Every day, she would sprint her way to the ground with a sense of joy and enthusiasm. By the time she started college, she was in the sports circuit as a professional. In fact, she won the girls' football competition, representing Tilak College, Mumbai University. Although not very active at the moment, she does ensure not to miss a single game as a spectator. Needless to say, she still pulls out an all-nighter for El-Classico!",13,8,0,female,0,10

I possesses a greater level of knowledge, skills and abilities.

Earlier,
I served as an Account Receivable Analyst & Healthcare Recruitment positions.

My job involves making sure businesses avoid bad hires. I help companies solve their recruitment problems by finding high-quality talent to help them realise their objectives.

My strongest asset is my ability to build and maintain relationships. I’ve developed a long list of employers and businesses who turn to me when they need new talent. These range from multi-million-dollar corporations to local sole traders.

When it comes to building productive relationships, I always refer to a quote by Suzy Kassem: ‘Treat your relationship as if you are growing the most beautiful sacred flower. Keep watering it, tend to the roots, and always make sure the petals are full of color and are never curling. Once you neglect your plant, it will die, as will your relationship.’ By following this guidance when managing relationships my clients, I’ve been able to not only improve client satisfaction, but also increase revenue.

Since 2019, I have personally sourced over 900+ candidates and presented them to employers. Over 87% of my permanently hired candidates have remained with their employer for at least 12 months.

I am always eager to hear from both jobseekers and employers, so feel free to get in touch with me to discuss job openings or recruitment solutions.",24,1,0,male,1,0

""𝑰𝒕 𝒊𝒔 𝒂𝒍𝒘𝒂𝒚𝒔 𝒃𝒆𝒕𝒕𝒆𝒓 𝒕𝒐 𝒍𝒊𝒈𝒉𝒕 𝒂 𝒄𝒂𝒏𝒅𝒍𝒆 𝒕𝒉𝒂𝒏 𝒕𝒐 𝒄𝒖𝒓𝒔𝒆 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒅𝒂𝒓𝒌𝒏𝒆𝒔𝒔""

How did I light a candle 🕯️? 
- I worked joyfully (and hard enough) to be among the 𝐓𝐨𝐩 𝟏𝟎% revenue contributor at Byjus, driving 𝟏.𝟓 𝐂𝐫.+ revenue in the first year in an individual contributor role.

- I worked joyfully (and even harder) to be one of the 𝐓𝐨𝐩 𝟏𝟎𝟎 𝐒𝐚𝐥𝐞𝐬 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐨𝐧𝐬 across India (with 10000 associates competing) to earn an all-paid lavish incentive trip to Europe.

- I worked enthusiastically (and hardest) to contribute 𝟐𝟎 𝐂𝐫.+ of revenue as a Business Development Manager, handling a team of 15+ people and training more than 40 associates during the journey, enabling the promotion of 10+ managers.

P.S: I love hanging out with Google Sheets !! 𝗡𝗲𝘅𝘁 𝗚𝗼𝗮𝗹: 𝗠𝗮𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗦𝗔𝗔𝗦 𝗦𝗮𝗹𝗲s and Copywriting.

------- The Non-Work Life Column -------

A few indispensable things to my daily life are:
Networking; Reading Books and Newsletters; Finding Productive Tools; Consuming Selective Contents and Procrastinating (Haha).

What do I do on the weekends?
- 1-1 Mentoring Calls with people across the globe.
- Guide Millenials (through posts; over call; through chats; however possible)
- Travel (Just Love It)

-------- The Ultimate Goal ---------

Designing a life where 𝐈 𝐠𝐞𝐭 𝐩𝐚𝐢𝐝 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐢𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 & 𝐬𝐩𝐞𝐚𝐤𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐚𝐜𝐫𝐨𝐬𝐬 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐠𝐥𝐨𝐛𝐞. Build a nomad workstation for myself. Sooner or later, I am confident, I will reach there :)

I tried my hands on Software development and Quality assurance (both manual and automation testing) in organisations like Aricent, Adobe, and Grofers before I found my interest in the profession of Product Management.

Instead of doing an MBA, I preferred continuing my corporate experience and learning the skills of Product Management by reading (Medium, Books, Newsletters) and watching the Product Managers work style in Grofers from the sidelines.

One day an opportunity came and I qualified for the role of an Associate Product Manager in Grofers which started my 6 years (many more to come) journey of Product management.

In Grofers, I learned how execution works in a modern-day startup. There, I have worked with people at all levels of the organisation; from a delivery executive to the CEO and the investors.

Life brought me to Microsoft 4 years back where I became a part of the team which was reimagining the experience of Microsoft Office on mobile and that led to the birth of the Microsoft Office mobile app which is now available on Android and iOS, Download and check it out :)

I am currently working as a Principal PM Manager in the PowerPoint team where we have the mission of 'Enabling users to tell compelling stories anytime anywhere and we are thinking of some revolutionary features which help us achieve this mission using cutting-edge technology.

If not at work, I enjoy my time by trying different restaurants ( Yeah, a big foodie) and write their reviews on Zomato ( A small bit for the community), Watching movies, Reading about new trends, philosophies, tools, and mental models.

It's all about the right mindset and right direction, believe me, good things take time only if you have the right strategy to do it.

Hi there, I am Binati Sheth from Gujarat, India. I am your friendly neighbourhood ghostwriter. No, I don’t write ghost stories. I write other people’s nonfiction books for them.

How did I get here?
Simple. 

💡I love ideas. I am addicted to new ideas. Old ideas, when reworded and reframed, make me tingle. Ideas make life worth living. I wanted to breathe new life into these ideas. I can write. 

🧠I love nuance. Context is everything. Each idea and story need a point-of-view. I can make people talk and I can play the devil’s advocate to get that perspective action going.

📚I love books. Reading literally and figurately changed my life. Books are powerful. Writing and publishing a book comes with heavy responsibilities. I can tell you when your draft is ready to be a manuscript.

So…

📧If you’ve got ideas but the words are failing you, contact me.

📧If you’ve got book concepts but somehow the book isn’t coming together, contact me.

📧If your book is done and it needs that finishing touch, contact me because I also edit nonfiction books.

📧If you’ve got a book in you and you feel like you can trust me, contact me.

It would be an honour to get your story out there, getting the attention it deserves. 

☑To contact me, email your requirements at hello@binatisheth.com. If you’re not sure, just email me a shower thought. If the shoe fits, you will have the best of times. If it doesn’t, you will have more clarity on what you want.

On to LinkedIn, I create and seek thought diversity. I have five content creation pillars. If they interest you, give me a follow and ring my bell for post notifications.
1. Business/Work - Writing, Editing, Ghostwriting, Publishing, Productivity, Creativity, Mindfulness
2. Personal - Journaling, Gardening, The writer life, Collaboration, Random thoughts
3. Content Topics - Opinion pieces, Bitter Pills to Swallow, Infographics
4. Reading - Books and all things Literature, Etymology
5. The Writing Catalogue - Everything about my website, Marketing essays and blogs

That’s me!

Started my career working with Blue Lotus Communications Pvt.Ltd as a PR executive handling clients like J&J, Helen Keller Institute, Carwale, TiE India, & Sherpalo Ventures. Then moved on to being part of the brand management teams at HUL & Airtel. 

Post Airtel began my entrepreneurial journey. My first venture was a co-working space in Mumbai, Gemini New Media Ventures (GNMV) LLP (www.imgemini.com) which is a 200 seater coworking space with a spectrum of startups working out of the space. I along with my Co-Founder started GNMV Spaces when coworking was a very new concept and have seen the entire journey of how coworking has emerged as a concept in India. My second venture was started in 2016 called BECKFriends – a same day delivery platform in Mumbai which then pivoted to become BECKFriends.com – a global traveller powered delivery marketplace. BECKFriends.com is one of the first movers in the space of peer to peer logistics and is bringing together two of the largest sectors globally – travel & logistics, to build a sector where travel powers logistics. Today BECKFriends is a SAAS product that gets aligned with the airline or travel partner interface to offer an integrated solution to end users & partners.

And my journey continues further with www.purnayog.com, a venture that encourages people to move towards living a holistic life. The venture aims to bring in the wisdom of yoga to the world in a way that it gets demystified, accessible and easily adaptable in the modern life. A large part of this includes coaching professionals and organisations to tap into the true potential of Human Resource by acknowledging them as holistic beings and creating an organisational environment in which they can thrive rather than survive. Through PurnaYog I lead independent sessions as well as chalked out long term programs to bring in the right intervention in the corporate & startup setups. These interventions lead to create a more sustainable & growth oriented environment addressing the physical, mental, emotional & spiritual well being of the employees and stake holders.

I am a certified digital marketeer & a digital strategist.

During my 15+ years’ association with corporate pharmaceuticals, I have helped pharmaceutical organizations set up their digital and automation strategy from scratch. I have helped organizations utilize the power of online with conventional offline strategies in their existing organizational setup.

My key areas of interest include online automation, medical/pharmaceutical communications, transforming conventional communications to digital, creation of online repositories, mobile apps, data analytics, etc. I have been associated with several doctors and healthcare providers and have been instrumental in implementing digitalization in many state pharmacy councils, institutions, and companies. I have played a key role in the digitalization of some pharmacy councils in India including Karnataka State Pharmacy Council (KSPC) and Himachal Pradesh State Pharmacy Council (HPSPC).

I love to teach the basics of digitalization and digital skills to Pharmacy professionals for better adoption of technologies via my digital literacy programs. I conduct weekly free webinars, every Saturday at 02.00 PM via Zoom for pharmacy students, faculty, and industry professionals to create awareness about countless opportunities in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industry. The practical pointers from these webinars can help our professionals plan their careers better and help them be a better version of themselves. Some of the past session’s videos could be accessed here 🎬 https://bit.ly/PharmacyCareerOpportunities on YouTube 

I am resource personnel for India’s first 2-day orientation program for M. Pharm students. The Karnataka State Pharmacy Council (KSPC) and Rajiv Gandhi University of Health Sciences (RGUHS) jointly conduct the program. More about this program here www.pharmadisha.com

Here's what my current journey looks like  👇🏻

I started my first venture at the age of 15, A Content Creation business. We used to create content around technology driven by curiosity, We managed to attain 1.6k+ Subs with 150k+ views in 4-5 Months but the venture didn't last long since it became a lot difficult to manage schooling & business at the same time. 😞

But it wasn't the end of my curiosity but rather the beginning of Something Bigger! I came across the word entrepreneur in 2019 & it was the word that defined me, I worked over My first startup as an Aggregator platform in 2019 but failed due to an improper & unsustainable business model.

After working with over 2 more startups by end of 2020, Finally, one of the startups was selected in Thiel Fellowship 2nd round ( Initiative by a Paypal Mafia), A moment full of excitement.. shattered when we didn't qualify ahead & the problem was Lack of Connectivity with Mentors & Investors.

That was the point where StartedUp ( helping startups navigate through the ecosystem ) was born, we decided to build a platform that solves our problem! Where I managed to achieve 100X growth in 6 months & Build a community of 1400+ Founders & Aspirants, along with it I have interacted & got an opportunity to get mentored by People who has founded company worth $5.6Bn+, Raised from Sequoia, Y combinator & many more 🤯  

Till now, I have helped 350+ entrepreneurs in starting up and helped startups to raise more than ₹10M+. Moreover, I have been nominated for the Young Entrepreneur Award by IAF & have been recognized as Startup Mentor & Investor by 10+ institutions & have addressed 1,000+ entrepreneurs at bodies such as IIT Bombay, IIT Madras, NIT-Bhopal, Startup Uttarakhand, Business Blasters, etc.

I have completed my graduation in BTech-IT but never believed in sticking myself to academics. 

I participated in many college events, and have secured various positions in college societies. 

- Started the GeeksForGeeks student Chapter in my college, 
- Served the Literary Society of my college as a Core team member for a year and was promoted to the Executive member position.
- Student head of technical magazine of IT department
- Previously served DSC student Chapter as a Content Head.

I got my first paid content writing internship as a freshman back in 2019 simply because I took a risk that paid off. My parents asked me to quit because it was paying peanuts. But I decided to continue with the same. This opportunity gave me the hands-on experience to effectively hit a target within a particular time frame, persuade people to read my blog and write 6 blogs a week for a month. 

In 2020, I decided to explore everything possible, and this pandemic acted as a cherry on my cake. 

I completed 20+ internships in the fields of marketing, blog writing, website development, and graphic designing with various organizations, tech and non-tech communities, startups, and renowned companies. 

Public Speaking was my passion and biggest fear. I started my talk series and stood up from that fear. I have done 170+ webinars with 100+ speakers and created a community of 380+ members to this day. 

I have been invited as a guest speaker by various organizations and individuals for live sessions. Compiled an anthology ""Efficacious""

I have published a research paper under IEMIS 2020 on Blockchain and Machine Learning: Background, Integration, Challenges, and Application areas with my colleagues. 

I have been featured on various online platforms like Refrens, Young Influx, YouthBing, Talks, and Tales, Infigon Talks and Your Story My Pen where my life journey is published in form of blogs, photos, and videos

Services I provide- 

1. Social Media Marketing
2. Building and managing communities
3. Managing Online Events
4. Blog Writing 
5. LinkedIn Personal Branding 

You can also invite me as a Guest Speaker if you find me credible enough to speak on the topics I mentioned above.

Currently, I build communities, manage social media platforms for brands and create content on LinkedIn and Twitter, educating my audience on the community management domain and crowning it up with some real-life stories.

What do you do after 3 failed startups? Well, you convert all of that into standup comedy!

I have a special comedy set called 'Startup To Shutdown' where you'll laugh non-stop for 45 minutes while I talk about building a POC, hiring, ESOPs, interns, freelancers, Indian customers, creating pitch decks, AI, ML, Blockchain, SAAS, raising investments, types of investors, startup events, finances, stress, family, mentors, accelerators, co-working spaces, recession, cofounder conflicts & shutting down a private limited :P 

My second comedy special is called 'Matlab Kuch Bhi' which is my funny take on life. This content will connect with anyone and everyone (except my mom who's now convinced no one will marry me 😜)

If you want your employees to laugh for 45 minutes & forget the pandemic, email me 'anmolgarg238@gmail.com' 

I also run a show called 'News You Can Misuse' where I combine weekly news with comedy (imagine Arnab with humor - wait, I know you can't imagine that 😅)

Travelling and Internet can change your perception towards life, I left my home at the age of 15 and started travelling as much which also helped me understand the value of earning and spending money.

I write actively on Personal Finance, Credit Cards and Startups in general on Twitter and LinkedIn, and periodic columns in leading media publications. I talk about sustainability and recently exposed two malicious Influencer Marketing Campaigns against Meesho and EaseMyTrip.

Ever since my childhood (literally, like when I was 12 years old), I started a debate club. Back then, I got 8 students from my class and a total of 14 students from other sections together to debate on motions like - THBT ozone layer depletion is a man-made disaster in the making. Trust me, those days this is all we used to talk about.

However, I fell in love with content and community building later when I started, Kuch Bhi Reviews - a YouTube channel. I, along with 2 of my friends, was successful in growing it to 3K+ community members that lead to 200K+ views in a year’s time on the YouTube channel. 

It was great learning that helped me understand the power of doing things together! 

Along with this, I kept participating in debate competitions across the country and got a chance to meet phenomenal speakers. It is when I enjoyed the most being a part of a community. 

In 2016, I decided to do my first internship. Where I got a chance to meet 100+ startup founders PAN India, I interviewed them for a digital marketing agency, Denziti Media under their project, High on Startup.

After such a crazy internship, I was pushed to take up a job but I hadn’t quite figured it out then. So, I joined an internship program in leadership hiring an executive recruitment firm, Crescendo Global Services to understand the recruiter mindset and market demand. Thankfully, I was able to get the answers I was looking for from this internship. 

Finally, I explored the community piece properly with CoHo, one of the 1st coliving brands of India. The journey with them was insightfully ecstatic. I curated over 250+ experiences in less than a year. Met so many people in these events and got to know countless beautiful stories.

I moved to Housr with an intent to build MEGA communities and have been exceedingly happy since then. Housr is India’s 1st MEGA coliving brand that means there are over 500 members living together in one establishment. Now, that’s what I’m talking about!

My true strength lies in my ability to celebrate the victory of another. Trust me when I tell you this, I wasn’t born with it. I had to learn it. If you’d like to know what I’m talking about then a cup of coffee is what I’d like to get with you.

I know that sounds like a lot of titles for just one person, but well that's because of just one quality of mine - I never stop learning. 

I am guessing if you're on my about section, you might be curious to know me beyond these titles. 
I'll embrace you with my journey.

I've always been a kid who used to figure out things on her own and was always curious to learn lots of new stuff.  

I was also someone who had it all planned out. But if it were to go as my plans, I won't have ever started writing. 

I am a Chartered Accountancy dropout, who left everything and actually followed her heart. I never realized but I was always into writing and selling it to people. I was a great communicator and I realized it very late.

I started working as a content writer at a startup and there I got to learn a lot more than just content. I learned about digital and social media marketing. I learned about selling web copies, communicating and strategizing ideas, and storytelling.

I believed in storytelling so much that I also ended up having an Instagram page named Humans of Bhopal in collaboration with my other 2 friends.  

I am currently a freelancer, aiming to learn more about content and marketing every day. 
I also write for an Instagram page. I have a blog too.
Apart from work, you'll find me sitting in a cafe with either a lot of people or just a cup of coffee and a great book, there's no in-between. I love singing, it helps me unwind.

I am on a mission to “Make Personal Development Easily Accessible"" to all.

""Your mindset can make you or break you."" Don’t believe me? It’s okay. I didn’t believe it either, not until I encountered a near-death experience in 2016 that forced me to delve into the path of spirituality, & personal growth.

Having spent 3 years battling mental health issues & prolonged illness, I realized the importance of holistic health & well-being. After living in survival mode for years, I realized the vital role mindset and holistic healing plays in your life.

I found my purpose & decided to use my voice to spread awareness about it. I am a writer by heart and a mindset coach by purpose. Writing is my passion, and personal development is my purpose. Hence I married these two in my content.

As a writer, my expertise is writing articles, blogs, landing page content, & course-based content for Wellness, Health, & Personal Growth/Self-Help brands. Topics that I excel at writing are Nutrition, Gut Health, Ayurveda, Yoga, Psychology, Mental Health, Meditation, Mindfulness, Personal development, Spirituality, & Manifestation.

Here's why you should connect with me:

If you are a person feeling stuck and looking for clarity in thoughts. I can help you get that clarity by challenging your inner coach within. I will help you claim your power back by tapping into your right mindset.

You are a Founder/CEO of a Health and Wellness company, looking for a writer who can help you convey the right brand message and establish an emotional connect with your target audience. I can help you do that through the power of storytelling and empathic writing.

You are a Founder/CEO of a Mental Health company, looking for a writer to express the voice of mental health patients, drive awareness and attract the right target audience; I can help you. Having worked closely with a telehealth brand providing therapy to people, I can help you connect the missing dots to strengthen your brand positioning.

You are a Life coach looking for someone who can create thought-provoking content that hits the right chord with your target audience. I am the writer for you. I can help you with all your content needs, from blogging to copywriting, from Course description to Landing page content. I can help you by weaving thought-provoking content that urges the readers to dive within their psyche & spiritual core.

Because we are here to experience ourselves in every colour. 

Few events leave a stronger impression on us, others seem like distant memory. And do you know? We can let go of the darker shades even with a single crack of light passing through and become radiant again. It takes that one crack and I'm here for you. ✨


“Oh! here comes another Life Coach”, is that on your mind too?

Don't worry, I won't bombard you with heavy and cliche personal growth tips or quick motivation that takes 5 seconds to deliver but hardly works in real life. Been there myself! 

Let me share a secret with you, I didn't choose life coaching but life coaching chose me. You know how?

When I was 13, I came across the term ""healer"" which made me curious. I took psychology in high school. But, life has its ways of bringing different experiences to you. That's how I landed in an engineering college. Felt good to start with, even got a core placement. But, something felt missing. That's when I began exploring different options, and life brought me back to my inner calling which is Life Coaching. 

Since then, I never looked back. And in the process, I could help 300+ people from different walks of life to achieve self-confidence, awareness and clarity of purpose in life.  

I hear this time and again that I am not old enough to become a life coach but the truth be told, I have dealt with childhood trauma, passive aggression, and low self-esteem and have overcome them with years of patience, effort, and guidance. 

And now helping my community effortlessly overcome life challenges with my experiences and methods.

My core approach to coaching lies in providing a safe healing space to open up, and making the whole process joyful. 

“Because the growth of any plant happens best in the right garden, & with the right nourishment.”

If you are feeling trapped or stuck & don't know where to go? Let's find your destination together. 

You can simply message me on LinkedIn “Interested in growth”

Later I joined a company as a salaried person and worked there for nearly three years. In 2015, I went ahead & did my MBA (Marketing). Together with that, I did some Web Development Training & Digital Marketing Course thinking it might help me in my own business in future.

I am Sandeep, and I have been a product management enthusiast since 5 years after I completed my MBA with XLRI

I currently work as a Product Manager for Entain, UK’s second-largest sports betting firm. I devise the product prioritisation and road mapping quarter-on-quarter and lead a small team of junior product managers to execute the roadmap. I own three functions – Customer onboarding and KYC, new market entry, and responsible gaming. My main objective is to reduce the friction in customer journeys introduced by various regulations. Very recently, we launched our products in Ontario and I could onboard 85% of customers through an automated KYC process, resulting in a conversion ratio of 60%. I love to explain more about how we did it if you’d like to.

Before this, my stint was with Cognizant business consulting; I worked as a Product Manager for an e-commerce platform called Lykos. We sell base metals for SMBs based out of India and China. I have solved a various range of interesting problems around payments, risk management, digitisation of their supply chain, and receivables and payables financing. My solution of e-wallet has improved the payment success rate from 85% and 95%. We received amazing customer feedback about how simple and fast the solution is. My experience with this company is very customer-centric given how closely I worked with customers to understand and meet their goals.

Before product management, I worked as a corporate banker with ICICI bank. My trait of customer obsession started from here because of the vision of senior management about delivering exceptional customer service. For example, we promise to make every cross-border payment in 2 hours. In very few instances, I have missed this target as an individual contributor or as a team manager

Outside work, I also mentor my juniors at XLRI who wants to get into product management. I also help the non-tech savvy people in my family help them in their investments like MFs etc.",5,0,3,male,1,0

While I’ve bounced around different job roles but I’ve always been much better at managing big-picture projects and teams of individuals. 

Finding creative solutions to problems is something I have always enjoyed. As a kid I loved tinkering with things that were broken, figuring out how they worked and fixing them again. I am good at working in teams and making different people agree on the same page. Wanna know what else I am good at, here you go;

- Dynamic communication style: I am adept in building relationships, consensus and a shared sense of purpose. I am known for my ability to quickly establish trust with employees, mediate disputes and motivate others into action.

- I’m constantly learning new skills: For better or worse, this also includes skills outside my career as a project manager. Recently I learnt Python. 

- Data and Business Driven: I love solving business problems with unique algorithms and communicating complex ideas to business stakeholders. Offers expertise in understanding data and business and the ability to quickly learn new processes.

As a business coach, I aspire to enable and empower people to achieve their GOALS.

Who am I?
I was born and brought up in a small town in Gujarat. I went on to bag a master's degree in Electrical Engineering from SVNIT, Surat, which provided me with a wonderful opportunity to work with Essar for 8 years as a manager. Though an engineer by profession, my zeal for creative thinking and intuitive problem-solving paved this path for me. 
Being an early bird, an avid reader and a father of two gradually built me into a spiritually-inclined and emotionally-alert individual. 
I have been walking this path as a business coach since 2015, and have managed to lead 238+ CEOs, and 5000+ employees from 4 countries along the way.

What I believe,
I have pondered upon my life experiences and found that nurturing every tiny task I undertook helped me become more responsible and respect my work even more. I decided to put that power of nurture to use and help fellow leaders embrace sustainable growth. That too, with dollops of happiness as they embark on a difficult endeavor called startup. I believe that both, the means and the ends, matter when it comes to actions that impact and empower people. 

“Nurturing possibilities” allows me to bring the best out of everyone. “My nature is my future” is my personal mission.

After finishing my graduation as a Mechanical Engineer from SRM University and working in Tata Motors for 6 months, I realised that this is not my field of work ( Yes self realisations always hits late for engineers🤭🤭).

After leaving a well paid job in Tata Motors I took to teaching students Soft Skills and became a Skill Development Trainer training lot of college students help improve their communication skills and I found my area of calling in Training People.

That was when Covid struck and I was no longer employed which made me go sane like everyone for few months. During the time I started preparing IELTS and tried my luck in that field.

To my surprise I hit a good score in my first attempt itself and took a liking for teaching others as well. Later seeing my good score my friend approached me to teach him IELTS and he got good score that helped him reach his desired country.

From then on my students have reached prestigious universities in Canada, UK , Australia, New Zealand by acing the coveted IELTS exam.

Along with IELTS I also diversified into OET as well and gave the wings to healthcare professionals to migrate to their dream destination abroad and continue their profession.

I also provide Communications training to people whose communications skills have hampered their progress up the CORPORATE ladder and make sure that they regain their lost confidence and mojo back.

Yes, this works, and it did work for me in my career though with caveats. Started my career as a trainer with a small training company, I now help businesses in effectively managing their Human Capital to achieve their business goals.

My nearly 3 decades long career gave me an opportunity to work with Very Small, Small, Medium & Large organizations. This journey also blessed me with an opportunity to work with some of the top-notch leaders and I owe all my learning to them and to the challenges presented by them.

I strongly believe that HR is not just a function, but it is an approach that a business owner has towards his/her business…it’s a Mindset!

Strong belief in the term HUMAN. All strategies, best practices, technologies can be a waste if the Human Capital is not energized. 

I have chosen to work with SMBs in my Mission as this is one segment which has little or no focus & lesser resources to manage their HR. 

I am on a MISSION to empower the SMBs. 

In my second career innings, I am supporting Small & Medium Businesses in adapting a healthy n effective People framework and also mentor HR professionals to help them improve their HR skills

I am currently with Zee as a Senior Product Manager, working towards achieving our vision of becoming the No.1 Vernacular OTT Platform.

As a kid, I have seen a running business very closely and have occasionally helped my father run his apparel shop. My college life was full of small entrepreneurial adventures too - from being an independent event organizer to running a food delivery venture. 

This early onset of the entrepreneurial bug led me to become the founder of afo.fit, a social fitness platform, in 2020. We tried to solve the problem of consistency and motivation in fitness using social, competition and rewards. Due to lack of scalability, we decided to shut it down and move ahead with great learnings for future ventures.

Before my stint as a founder, I worked with products in the zero to one stage because I love building new things. Data science is also a key part of my career, where I have built ML/AI-based products for healthcare, logistics and retail clients. Now, I am striving to go deeper into the craft and share my learnings along the way.

I am 24 now and you may not see me playing at the Eden Gardens or at the Wankhede , but you'll definitely find me playing cricket once or twice a week either in the street or the turf.

The reason I mentioned cricket right at the beginning is because it has taught me a few skills that will define my career and what I stand for always:
      * Team Work
      * Discipline
      * Resilience, and the ability to fail and learn from mistakes.

Fast Forward to the present - I am a Data Analyst where my daily job  typically revolves around helping clients to generate actionable insights using data, often for the stakeholders and non-technical audience. 

My Specialties :-

* SQL to perform data analysis for large datasets
* MS SQL Server - Creation/Modification of Jobs, Stored Procedures, Functions, Linked Servers
* Tibco Spotfire and MS Power BI for creating Business Intelligent reports 
* Python for Data Science and Data Analytics
* Process Improvements
* Customer and Client Relations 
* MS Excel, MS Power-Point to prepare presentations for Stakeholders.

Over Time, I have found that nothing satisfies me more than helping others, building relationships, thinking out of the box and the challenge of being told ""no"" and turning it to a ""yes""

Owning your life doesn't come easy. Why? Because this process of learning how to requires YOU, the reader, to be a part of it. It won't happen with any Artificial Intelligence. It will take ""Real Intelligence"".

Sukhi believes in people and their talents and abilities. He knows most of them have never used them. That's where Sukhi comes in and teaches and trains them to recognise those hidden talents and abilities.

Sukhi loves people as they are. He has learned from experience that the most vital skill a person needs on this planet is to learn how to deal with people. People first, everything else later. Sukhi will teach you how to be a people's person. All successful people of the past and the present are great in dealing with people.

Make friends with Sukhi, connect with him and he'll help you learn from his experiences. Last but not the least Sukhi will teach you to build your own organisation (home based business) and you can be your own boss (an emerging need). You can design your own future if you have a DESIRE*.

There is always something new to discover, perhaps a new kind of technology that can be applied in various ways or a new algorithm to reduce a coding challenge solution's time complexity. Nevertheless, these discoveries all serve one overarching goal: how can we, as humans, bring an impactful career to society and evolve success in every possible way.

Systems are how we view the world. Design is how we change the world.

As a junior studying Engineering Physics (co-op) at McMaster University, I am excited to explore entrepreneurial ventures in the technology sector and incorporate innovative design into our everyday lives. With two full year of experience in various technology and leadership roles in and outside of school, I aspire to drive change by developing solutions to leverage and build an impressive career in people's lives, promoting Machine Learning and Automation to various sciences creating a sustainable future.

My name is Aditya Kaushik, and I am a mechanical engineering senior. I learned some strange things about startups while I was in 9th grade, and it finally became something that intrigues me the most, aside from cars and motorcycles. 

I began approaching people with the goal of learning about their ideas and figuring out how I could add value and learn what I wanted. I believe there is a significant difference between learning something and putting it into practice. 

As a result, I concentrate on the second. And with that perspective, I was able to work with a variety of businesses, which allowed me to develop a strong understanding of the ecosystem while also assisting me in identifying my areas of specialty. 

Mechanical design engineering, strategic consulting, and financial markets are my key areas of interest.
I'd love to work with startups and assist them with digital marketing, strategy development, and growth.

Through my hard work and dedication, I was able to prove my skills and win over the confidence of my seniors, I was soon offered a full-time DevOps role at the same company. 

After joining as a DevOps engineer,  I gained expertise in working with Kubernetes and AWS. In fact, I cleared the official examination of Kubernetes to become a Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD) with a near-perfect score of 96/100. Similarly, I was also able to clear official AWS examinations such as Solution Architect - Associate & SysOps Administrator - Associate.  

Today, I am proud to say that I am a 1x Kubernetes and 2x AWS certified engineer. And I am even more proud to say that I cleared these exams on my first attempt.

Currently, my focus is on upskilling myself and exploring other interesting avenues in the industry such as Cloud Native tools and Databases. I have also played around with Chaos engineering!

I have been working with cloud-native tools like Elastic Stack, Terraform, Vault, Istio, and Consul while exploring and learning more and more about them. I am confident that I will gain expertise on these tools very soon! 

I have also explored databases - as in the processes and methods to create and manage highly available, fault-tolerant database implementations of databases like Postgres and Redis. 

Apart from my work, I also like to experiment with new DevOps tools and approaches. I regularly share my insights and findings through articles on LinkedIn and other blogging sites. Do check them out!

It is my goal to become a world-class DevOps engineer and make a mark in this field which I absolutely enjoy working at :)

As a writer, marketer, electronics and software engineer, I can look at the same problem from multiple angles and come up with creative solutions (or redefine the problem statement!). 

I've led marketing for The Ken, the biz journalism site that brought subscriptions to Indian news, and also The Caravan (recommended their pivot from advertising- to subscription-journalism). At P&G, I led the turn-around for Tide—the $250mn laundry brand with iconic Chaunk Gaye! ads—used in over 80 million households across India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh. Also launched Tide Pods in India. When I was a developer at Amazon, I created automation to flag ""bad ads"" efficiently.

All my stories, observations and insights are now in one (unsolicited) place—www.ramachandranesk.in 👀

My essays on culture, biz, tech, politics have appeared in The Caravan, ThePrint, VICE, Fifty Two, Rest of World, The Quint, and other leading publications. I am part of the 2022 Class of South Asia Speaks, working on my first book, a collection of essays, called Famous Last Questions, about life in contemporary Indian society.

I also help Indian startups (B2B & B2C) solve their marketing challenges—from positioning and strategy to campaign and content creation. I've previously led marketing for The Ken, a pan-Asian digital publication that pioneered subscribers-only business journalism in India, and also The Caravan, India's finest magazine of politics and culture (recommended their pivot from advertising-driven to subscription journalism). At P&G, I led the turnaround for Tide India — the iconic $250 million brand with the Chaunk Gaye? campaigns — used in over 80 million households across India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh. Also launched Tide Pods in India. Before my MBA at IIM Calcutta (India's oldest B-school?), I created automation at Amazon to flag 'bad' ads more efficiently.

Advertising has thus always been a part of my life (my dad used to work on the agency side), and now that it's taken over our lives, I find myself thinking about persuasion, perception, and the nature of reality a lot. My professions and interests have followed each other across multiple disciplines — broadly different kinds of science, business, and art. I love being a 'generalist', even though it comes with hot envy for specialists. What I hate is purposelessness and stagnation; so I try to keep things challenging (but not TOO much). 

Some more (self-proclaimed) fun facts: ⌨️ My typing speed is 101 wpm but I still can't stop this typed self-promotion fast enough. I blame it on the times we live in. 🎭 A play I directed was performed at the National Centre for Performing Arts, Mumbai. I've won 2 to 3 comedy improv competitions.

It took me around 10 months to switch from a service based to a product based company. I started my coding journey after I got my job at TCS. When I started coding I was zero and had no clue from where and how to start.

Slowly upon practicing everyday I gained decent level of expertise in coding which finally helped me to crack a job at a Product based company.

• has an interest in modern hybrid app development and SOLID design.

Exceptional Challenges:
1) I have created an application for an EdTech startup. They want to avoid installing the application on an emulator. In React Native there are packages to check emulator but those are not working 100%. During my start-up, I have created a function using Java for Android for the same functionality. Using bridging technology of React Native, I called that method and implemented on React Native.

2) We know through reverse geocoding we can find the address from latitude and longitude. But for that we have to take subscription of geocoding API. One of my client wants this feature but don't want to take subscription. So for IOS, I used free API https://api.bigdatacloud.net/data/reverse-geocode-client. But it is not providing accurate result so for Android I used bridging technology and android.location.Geocoder API to find accurate address.

Worked with ShareChat, India's no. 1 social media app, as a Software Engineer. I contributed to ShareChat and Moj both. Moj is India's no. 1 short video app developed by ShareChat. At that time, ShareChat and Moj were having more than 400 Million monthly active users.

I love to teach. The smallest gestures often make the biggest differences. The more sessions I conduct, the more knowledge I gain. As much as people learn from me, there is a lot more I learn from them. Sharing knowledge doesn't put me behind in the queue. It keeps me on the top of the stack. I have trained more than 5000 students from different colleges like PSIT (Kanpur), DIT University (Dehradun), Chandigarh Group of Colleges (Mohali), and ABES Engineering College (Ghaziabad). And the students have cracked big product-based companies & startups like Goldman Sachs, Flipkart, Morgan Stanley, CRED, Atlassian, Amazon, RedHat, Commvault Systems, ShareChat, etc.

I have been a keynote speaker in 4 colleges so far.

Also, I create video content for cracking the coding interviews and company-specific preparation.

Thanks for landing here :)

I am Nishtha Gupta, a Chemical engineer turned Data Scientist. Currently working with Deloitte and getting experience on technologies and tools such as Microsoft Azure Databricks, SQL, Python, and Power BI

Last year, I came across the field of Data Science and was fascinated by how it can be applied to most domains. 

I tried exploring it further and eventually found my inclination towards it. I deep-dived into the concepts of Machine Learning Algorithms such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, etc. using Python libraries to understand how a broad set of data can be analyzed and interpreted. 

It took me a decent 3 months to get multiple offers in this space by figuring out the right ways to apply for jobs and building a resume.

Does this sound like you in your career? 😮

My name is Ritika, and I am a 4th year Kinesiology student at UBC. Irrespective of my background, I've always strived to work in the top consulting companies and hopefully enable others from non-target schools to do the same. I've had the opportunity to work with multiple startups, non-profits and other companies and seeing thousands of other students hoping to do the same, I wanna help. This is the reason why I post content on this platform.

My goal is ""to raise awareness about students specifically international students from non-traditional backgrounds and help them transform into winners"". 

There is this quote that my mom says ""Keep striving, keep challenging yourself and keep growing because when the desire to develop diminishes, that's when an individual has failed""

🏆 My Highlights:
🙏🏻 Founded a non-profit, called Re-Defined at the age of 21. Helped more than 3000+ people in 3 countries
🏢 Mentored around 200+ students across India, Canada and Africa. 
✨Won CMC-BC student award for excellence in Management Consulting and Student Excellence in Kinesiology
 🙌🏼 Won Business lEadership Award 2022 and Indian Achiever Award by IAF (Indian Achievers Forum)
✨. Featured in magazines including Michigan Times, Study International, Rushhour times, Inforens and many more

Wait, Here's my story to know better 💁‍♀️

When I started my career I could never imagine myself doing a lot of things altogether, really! 

But here I'm. While doing my first internship as a Data science intern. I realized only technical skills won't take me to next level. 

I need to develop soft skills and focus on personal development. So, I started a podcast called 'We Exceptions'.

Podcasting gave me wings and introduced me to this beautiful world of CONTENT CREATION. Then I started creating content along with my internship and podcasting.

Fast forward a YEAR 

My internship ended and I got a full-time role as ML Engineer. Learned crazy things about tech.

Realized the platform I love making content on is LINKEDIN. Yes, right here.🤍

'We Exceptions' The podcast I started has 20+ episodes with the stories of people I admire.

Now, I'm constantly challenging myself and seeking discomfort to grow and learn. 

The good news is I can help you do the same and a few more things listed below:

✨If you want practical personal development & career tips. I share my learnings from books, podcasts, and experiences here, follow me along the way.

✨If you want me to write for you, I can write blogs, copy, LinkedIn posts, Twitter threads, video scripts, and reel scripts on personal development, books, and careers.

✨If you are a person who wants me to create content for your personal brand or company. I have experience in speaking in front of the camera and can make Reels and videos for you.

✨If you want 1:1 career guidance in tech, content creation, or podcasting. Reach out to me, I'm right here for you.

✨If you want your story and learnings to be featured on my podcast. Reach out to me, happy to talk.

This was my story, I would love to know yours. Seriously, I'm not kidding.👀

You loved something about my profile, which makes you read this.
Is it my storytelling skills? My tag of a social media marketer/ organic marketer?  If not, is it a deduced thought that I'm a Personal Branding 'expert'?
Even if it's something else, I'm glad you did. 

I'm Rose, but the ones who care less about reading my name call me Maria or something else🫤

I'm a social media marketer who helped clients across 4 continents, having the majority of my social media marketing clients from the US. 

Fashion isn't my passion. So, though an FD graduate, I chose my passion & started my freelancing journey on August 2021 as a writer cum social media marketer. Before that, for 5 years as a student, I had experience in social media marketing. Though I did social media marketing to kill time & help my dear ones in the past, it is my career at present. 

My Social Media Marketing journey started with building a personal brand & 10k followers on Instagram. The time taken was just 4 months, though I knew nothing about Instagram Algorithm. Over time, the community did grow up to 27k when I disabled the account. 

On LinkedIn, I recognised my social media marketing skills in 2021. I generated 3 millions+ content impressions for one of my clients here, which gave me the confidence to become an active social media marketer specialising in LinkedIn growth. 

I worked with clients from 4 continents in the following areas, along with my team:
1️⃣Storytelling
2️⃣B2B Social Media Marketing
3️⃣B2C Social Media Marketing
4️⃣Personal Branding for Founders/ employees/ freelancers
5️⃣Content strategy for social media growth

Along with long-term social media marketing projects, I worked on the social media marketing of many global events.

Social media marketing is exciting for me, but I know it is not the same for many, maybe including you. That is why I'm here to help you with my expert team of social media marketers. 

You are at the right spot if you are trying to:
👉🏻Have a consultation for Social Media Marketing.
👉🏻Have suggestions for bettering your social media marketing strategy.
👉🏻Have someone figure out why your Personal Branding or Business branding isn't effective.

❓Want to create a great Personal Brand in just 101 days? 
❓Want to generate 3x revenue by a social media strategy that works for you?
❓Want to generate quality business leads in 90 days through the right social media marketing?

I'm your social media marketing mate at your text distance & I can help you.

Coming from an education system that successfully prepares me to be a clerk, PGPM from Vanguard Business School just changed my life overnight. The ""Spirit of Vanguard Award"" instilled great faith in myself.

1. Take Charge: Life will never be a bed of roses. My stint at Airtel just prepared me for life. When the telecom sector is going through a radical change, ""taking charge"" was the only option which helped me outperform my senior peers inspite of being a novice.

2. Be Impatient: When you are confronted by a humongous first quarter, you cannot rest on your laurels and let things happen. ""Be Impatient"" and go all guns blazing each day. I surprised myself by winning the ""Rising Star Award"".

3. Don't Ever Stop Questioning: I was extremely unambitious till my graduation. But the questioning attitude has given me a glimpse of my true potential and this journey is never-ending. 

Still making mistakes, learning from them, unlearning and relearning at every stage and I am enjoying my ride to the core. Life was, is and always will be uncertain and that what makes it so beautiful 🙂

Some of my Achievements-

Professional:
1. Won the ""Rising Star"" Award in iimjobs.com
2. Secured 3rd rank nationally for New Account Penetration Index in Bharti Airtel

Others:

Since my school days, I've had a passion for creating content, which eventually led me to publishing a Tech blog called Tech Storming, during my college days. The experience I gained through my blog, helped me bag a Content Writing internship at TrickTacToe.com (a tech tips and tricks website).

In 2014, after getting loads of experience in Blogging and Content Management, I joined Fratmart.com (a peer-to-peer marketplace for selling stuff online). At Fratmart, I was leading Front-End Design (UI/UX) and Social Media.

With relevant experience in Content, Social Media and Digital Marketing, I was able to get through the 2-year MBA program at NMIMS, Mumbai (2015-2017). I majored in Marketing. The highlight of my MBA program was reaching the finals of Future Group's Digital Case Study challenge, where my team showcased some path-breaking Digital Transformation scenarios to Kishore Biyani (CEO of Future Group).

In 2017, I joined HCL as a Presales Consultant. Parallelly, I also started working on my YouTube Channel Melt Your Cheese(launched in 2018) to spread my learnings in the fitness domain. Today, the channel is impacting more than 30000+ lives on YouTube and Facebook combined.

In the process, I also helped startups increase their presence on Social Media and eventually build businesses. 

In my free time, I run long distances, teach and hone my Content Marketing and Digital Growth skills.

My key focus areas:

- Content Creation, Marketing Strategy, and Content Marketing
- Collaborating with editing and design teams to produce high-quality content
- Developing editorial calendar, delegating tasks, and ensuring deadlines are met
- Delivering engaging content on a regular basis
- Regularly optimizing content considering SEO and Google Analytics
- Analysing web traffic metrics
- Regular ideation for customer engagement 
- Creating compelling video content across social channels such as YouTube, Instagram, Facebook and 
   LinkedIn, ensuring a strong web presence

My journey in this field began in 2016, right after I aced my Bachelor’s in English Literature. I wrote articles and features for a B2B magazine. What followed was an amazing experience where I got the chance to work on multiple content types – ranging from magazine features, blogs, scripts, emails, social media copies, proposals, and so on. 

All this helped me understand how content works on different channels. It also taught me the essentials of writing such as: understanding the target audience, finding the right tone, and communicating the essence of the brand effortlessly.  

Now, I work as a freelance content writer who can: 
-	Create 100% original and plagiarism-free content
-	Ensure no spelling and grammatical errors
-	Structure the content to make it compressive and easy to read
-	Optimize the articles based on SEO rules and keywords
-	Maintain the flow and adapt the tone quickly. 

In simple words, I know how things work and how to make things work when it comes to writing. 👩‍💻

I can adapt my content as per the audience and clients to offer the best copy. 

Here are some things about me as a content writer:
-	Specialized in writing long-form articles and blogs about lifestyle and travel
-	Worked with over 50+ brands like Mamaearth, Quintype, Scalenut, Stylecraze, AsiaOne Magazine, Travel Boutique Online, etc.,

I am a Product Recruiter @ Google, and I moonlight the Founder @ BobaTalks. And during wedding season, I'm likely planning or consulting :) 

🎉 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐝𝐨 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐝𝐨 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐟𝐮𝐧?

When I have the time, you can find me playing Pokemon Scarlet, learning new recipes, or taking photos :) 

💍 𝐀𝐫𝐞 𝐲𝐨𝐮 𝐚 𝐰𝐞𝐝𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐩𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐧𝐞𝐫?

Yes! I've done all sorts of weddings in all sorts of functions since 2017. I started off as a planner but have also done photography, coordination, wrote vows and I'm even ordained. Since 2021, I've moved into more of a ""𝒘𝒆𝒅𝒅𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒄𝒐𝒏𝒔𝒖𝒍𝒕𝒂𝒏𝒕"" to keep myself flexible for client's needs. 

🤍 𝐖𝐡𝐲 𝐁𝐨𝐛𝐚𝐓𝐚𝐥𝐤𝐬?

I was never the best with school - I am a (former) college dropout after all! But I know as well as many students reading this that the Early Career space is a brutally difficult space to be in. Sometimes, you really don't have your shit together and the impacts on your career and on your mental health is pretty devastating.  It can be overwhelming to even try to get started or to even ask for help. So BobaTalks is my promise to students, to give to them what wasn't available to me; resources, guidance, and information. So that way, they're a little better prepared than I was.

Having a humble approach towards the life I seek your support to help our dream to serve others.

Our start-up has developed DIYA, a rapid COVID-19 screening health-technology product that uses vocal biomarkers to ensure real-time screening and monitoring of COVID-19 patients, primarily asymptomatic ones.

Our product development is based solidly on the extensive testing of more than 70000+ biomarker samples. 

DIYA: Our rapid COVID-19 screening platform makes, both, early and asymptomatic detection of Covid-19 patients convenient, effective, and widely accessible – anywhere and anytime.

We have achieved 85% accuracy in tests conducted during its internal development and will soon launch large-scale, comprehensive, multi-centric clinical trials in Europe, the USA, and other countries across the globe.

Our platform ensures the highest standard of data privacy (GDPR compliant) & noise resistance.

USA, Canada, and European countries are in as much need of efficient and effective technologies like DIYA as are countries in Africa, South America, and Asia.

Its ease of use, accessibility, smart design, and high accuracy make it an important tool in our race against curbing the widespread of future mutations of COVID, breaking the chain of infection, and breaching the path of a prolonged pandemic – which is what the current scenario looks like.

我们的目标是通过使用具有突破性创新的人工智能来改善医疗保健服务，我们坚持我们的价值观来为人们服务。我以谦虚的态度对待生活，寻求您的支持，以帮助我们实现为他人服务的梦想。 
我们的初创公司开发了 DIYA，这是一种快速 COVID-19 筛查健康技术产品，它使用声音生物标志物来确保实时筛查和监测 COVID-19 患者，主要是无症状患者。
DIYA：我们的快速 COVID-19 筛查平台使 Covid-19 患者的早期和无症状检测变得方便、有效，并且可以随时随地进行。
我们在其内部开发过程中进行的测试已经达到了 85% 的准确率，并将很快在欧洲、美国和全球其他国家开展大规模、全面、多中心的临床试验。
我们的平台确保最高标准的数据隐私（符合 GDPR）和抗噪性。
我们的产品开发坚实地基于对 70000 多个生物标记样本的广泛测试。
美国、加拿大和欧洲国家与非洲、南美洲和亚洲国家一样，非常需要像 DIYA 这样高效和有效的技术。

它的易用性、可访问性、智能设计和高精度使其成为我们遏制 COVID 未来突变广泛传播、打破感染链和打破长期大流行路径的重要工具——这就是目前的情况看起来像。",0,0,0,male,1,0

I am Jigyasa and I am so happy that you are here.

Since childhood, I have been trying to understand what ""Happiness"" means. And very soon I realized ""Happiness"" is not going to happen on its own to anybody. But we have to create it daily, consciously, and step by step.

As I understood it, I started investing in myself to develop the same set of daily habits, mindset, and way happy and successful people think. After several years of studying, coaching, and experimenting on myself I am ready to create more ""Happiness Officers"".

Who are Happiness Officers?

Happiness officers are people who take responsibility for their own Happiness and help others to create their Happiness. They know it's okay to fail but they also know how to come back. They learn how to manage happiness. Now, you may ask:

What is Happiness Management?

We have been trained to ""Manage"" all important things which matter to us most. In school days they were our books, clothes, school supplies and now as adults we are so busy in managing our work, finances, portfolios and other things. But nobody ever taught us about  "" Managing Happiness"".  
Happiness Management is the art of leading a happy and successful life with deeper meaning.

How do I do it?

As your Happiness Management Coach, I can train you with effective tools and techniques. The workshops are designed to provide effective tools to understand the meaning of happiness and achieve it. All tools and techniques come without any expiry date because they are scientifically proven and result-oriented. 

Why corporates should do it?

Tools imparted in this training build for employee engagement & motivation leading to high employee happiness, employee retention & employee motivation. I am keen interested in creating more happiness officers.

I love building software solutions and believe that only if we start, then we can change the world. That is why I am constantly hustling after and before my full-time job to make our world a better place. Recently, I built my scripting language called ""lazy Language"" over python with a more simplified syntax and resembles pseudocode. It is uploaded to GitHub as an open-source. You can check the projects section in my profile. Some other open-source projects are NPM Packages: sockhttp, string-analysis.
Sockhttp is a simple library to create simple and secure APIs
String-Analysis is used to detect the tone of a sentence with detection and filtration of bad words. You can also fetch nouns, adjectives, and verbs from a sentence.

With a keen interest in management roles, I have studied project management and love practising it on a personal project ""Downbeat"". It s a Mental Health Support Group is started with the belief that every single one of us is resilient, and that our resilience can be fostered with the help and support of a community.

Why should you follow me ?
Here are many reasons to follow me

1. You will always get content around my real experience not fake content like others.

2. I have solved 1.5k+ dsa problems on just these three platforms geeks for geeks, leetcode  and hackerrank so yes i know how to practice efficiently on these platforms and what exactly you need to practice to crack product based companies.

3. In 2020 final year of college I got rejected in 10+ product-based companies off-campus in the final round back to back so yes i know what mistakes you must not do while giving interviews. These numbers are just in which i got rejected in final rounds. Later I improved after each rejection and got 2x, 3x and 4x times job offers from product-based companies than companies that rejected me.

4. I have gone through all most all product-based companies' interviews including google(Onsite process too) so I know what exactly you need to prepare to crack these companies so i share my experience around this too on LinkedIn. You can get benefits from my experience.

and many more...

Still you have any doubts or looking for any kind of help that i can do just dm me with reason. I will be happy to help you in every possible way.

If you are a recruiter or any organization and have an exciting opportunity for me then just dm or write to aks050798@gmail.com.

From there on, my path was crystal clear. It was either programming that would be my future or making it to Mars.

Literally. 👇🏻

I didn’t make it to Mars though.

Flash forward to my adult version and I’m a Senior Full Stack Developer (MERN) who is obsessed with writing lean-clean code for HackerBay Inc.

Full Stack Web Development is an ever-evolving field in which I’m passionately engaged with React.js and Node.js.

Web Development calls to ALL my passions; it incorporates creativity, problem-solving and I'm allowed to break it to improve the code (in a separate Git branch, of course).

As a Senior Full Stack Developer, my focus doesn’t sway from:

✔️  Translating Wireframes and PSD Designs into functional web apps using HTML5, React, Node.js, and MongoDB.
✔️  Binding UI elements to JavaScript object models.
✔️  Creating RESTful services with Node.js.
✔️  Architecting scalable web architectures.
✔️. Creating Unit and Integration tests to ensure code quality.
✔️. Writing code that is cross-platform and cross-device compatible.

Besides, I consistently give back to the tech-community as an Educator, Instructor, and Mentor at India's top learning platforms like Unacademy and Newton School.

I’m a storyteller and an optimist. I care deeply about the people I work with and the products we build. 
Here’s my story in the making…

➡️Entering the workforce
In my 20s, I believed I could change the world quickly. I invested my time upskilling and getting hands-on experiences. I asked a lot of questions to seek answers. I met incredible people along the way and became an integral part of innovative products. I celebrated when the products shipped and felt deep loss when they sank in this decade. 

⬆️Growing in the workforce
For the next decade, I have prioritized some parts of the world I truly want to change with my allies. I now invest more time un-learning and re-learning. I continue to ask questions to seek diverse perspectives and find my way to answers. I meet incredible people and I also empathize with those who are different from me. I can deal with difficult people and unfavorable situations. I root for visions that can turn into impactful products. I feel comfortable that some ideas will ship while some will sink along the way!

➡️Leading the workforce
A decade from now, I hope to have learned and unlearned enough to drive a meaningful impact in the prioritized parts of our world together. I will keep asking questions to fuel curiosity. My community of incredible and diverse people would help the people and conversations around us. Together we will ship some of the coolest and most meaningful products that would surpass the strongest tides.",2,1,0,female,0,0

A brief introduction about myself:

I have had a fairly interesting childhood, a wonderful school experience and a great time at the universities I've attended. I have tried to build an all rounded personality by doing well in academics, working at disparate organizations and most importantly enjoying every moment that life offered!

But all this--just like the 'perfect' movie--merely grasps the surface of the true complexity, resilience and dedication that went behind the scenes. 

My dreams entail a career in Finance in order to build a decent financial foundation from which I can give back to the community and influence others. Something that sticks with me is that everyone can make a living but only few can make a difference. 

But one important thing about me is that I am ambitious, I'm always more interested in the ""Why"" rather than the ""How"" and this has given me a drive unmatched by others. I sometimes make mistakes but recognize them quickly and yearn to grow into my best self each day. In my mind if I'm not doing anything to better myself from who I was yesterday, what's the point?",1,0,0,male,1,0

I am currently working on applying deep learning to computer vision and medical image analysis. Earlier, I was a research scholar at the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras (IIT-M) in the Healthcare Technology Innovation Centre (HTIC) under Mr. Keerthi Ram and Dr. Mohanasankar Sivaprakasam.

My previous research work primarily focused on medical image segmentation and reconstruction. I have published research papers in prestigious medical imaging conferences, including MICCAI, ISBI, MIDL, SPIE, and EMBC. Likewise, I have papers in renowned journals, including CMIG, and MedIA. I have been honored with the Institute Research award for my master’s thesis work.

Before joining graduate studies, I was a Project Associate in HTIC and have developed online annotation and visualization tools for high-resolution brain images using full-stack modules. Also, I participated in several medical image challenges, including mitosis classification, optic cup-disc segmentation, and polyp localization. Before that, I worked in couple of laboratories in IIT-M focusing on building devices for action and character recognition, respectively. 

Besides my inclination to research work, I love to make products to assist people. In my undergraduate studies, I made a product to help physically challenged people and deployed it in care homes. I have also worked with Hashbytes Technology Solutions and built software for the optical magnetic reader data extraction. The software was used to process around 3.5 million sheets for renowned government exams. 

In the future, I would like to bring together my research and product development expertise to develop amazing and impactful technologies.

Was curious to know how Google search works and what is the key algorithm which can answer almost every query considering people of different styles and languages of asking a question, lead me to the path of studying Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and related fields.

With this curiosity and to explore the field I decided to pursue Masters in Data Science and my research focuses on NLP, currently working on an interesting and one of the most researched and used domain of text classification using Recurrent Neural Networks like LSTM, and state of the art models like BERT and CNN.

Recently started exploring cloud as its the backbone of almost all applications and sites and is extremely useful to train and deploy Machine Learning Models on, which lead me to completing the Microsoft DP100 certification. Now focusing on expanding my knowledge and understanding the other two (AWS and GCP) clouds.

Passionate about AI, ML, BigData and usually like to keep myself updated with the recent trends and advancements in technology.

Being a creative person I can think about and present incremental and disruptive changes to the existing products and solutions and also help to build a new set of products along with identifying and prioritizing them for success which is key for a product manager.

Interested in giving technical talks and have spoken at few events and in college on the topics of Natural Language Processing, Data Science, Big Data, Python

This quote can't be more true to my life story.
After completing my graduation and post graduation in Banking & Finance, the most expected and obvious choice would be to work in any organization in the same sector. And yes, that's exactly what I did.
After working for 2 leading banks in India, I realized that my passion lies elsewhere.
After juggling with couple of other fields, I reached my true calling- TRAINING/ FACILITATING!
The last 8 years in the this field have been a learning and a liberating experience for me. I have stumbled many a times, but gathered the strength to get up and carry on.  I have successfully imparted trainings to more than 6000 participants from all walks of life (Students & professionals). 
Have successfully designed, developed and delivered workshops/ sessions in leading organizations for
1. Soft Skills
2. Leadership Development 
3. Interview Skills- CAMPUS TO CORPORATE
4. Communication Skills
5.  Etiquette 
6.  Personality Development
7. Public Speaking
8. Spoken English
9. Team Building
10. Personal Effectiveness
Being a Corporate Trainer, gives me the opportunity to meet and interact with participants, become a part of their learning journey, and make may be a small but positive impact in their personal as well as professional lives. 
Along the way, a new field also sparked my interest while guiding students and I pursued my certification in career counseling. As a Certified Career Counselor, I have successfully been guiding and helping students make the right and informed career choice.
Looking to enhance and improve many more professionals and students to realize their potential in their respective fields.

Trying my hand at law and finance made me realize that I had to look elsewhere because it was definitely not my cup of tea. When I went back into the world of IT, data was everywhere and it swept me in its tide

I started with Data Analytics and spent 1.5 years doing odd analyst jobs before I got the kind of role I wanted at McAfee where I am currently working in the reporting team using SQL, PySpark, Databricks. This role is at an intersection of Data Analysis, Data Science, and Data Engineering, which is very exciting to me

Currently, my LinkedIn will be brimming with SQL and PySpark posts, and this is a new obsession I have found, to learn while sharing and help others along the way

NOTE: I convert SQL solutions into PySpark because it's a personal mission to learn the latter that way, hands on first, then talk about the internal workings later on. 
I am aware I can use Spark SQL, I am aware that learning one makes the other redundant from a DE perspective, I am aware that SQL is omnipotent so I can ditch PySpark entirely. Still, I am learning PySpark because in time I want to cover Spark from that angle.

I help you convert this 'probability' into a 'reality' by making your startup “Funding-Ready”.
------------------------------------
Most funding mediators will introduce you to Investors/ VCs but they do not prepare you for being 'funding ready'. Even approved companies fail to get funding during legal and financial due diligence. This leads to a high rejection rate of startups.

I prepare your startup for funding, which means, I help you check all the boxes which investors need before agreeing to fund. And this is way way more than your pitchdeck or financial modelling. Get in touch with me to learn more.

My story of getting into copywriting is different and weird.

When I was a kid I hated writing so much! 

Even my high school English grade was ""C"".

Then, how did I get into copywriting?

It started with failing online. 

Yes, back in 2020 (when the whole world shifted online) I tried to sell products online.

But it didn't work out. So, then I start to look back and start finding my mistake.

...and I found one of the big mistakes in my product and that was 'No differentiating factor'

My product sounded like everybody else in the market.

I failed to show my product's benefits and how it can help my audience.

That's where started looking for a solution.

...and I found about copywriting and storytelling.

I started learning more about it and I found my love for it.

BTW, If you think that copywriting is just about writing fancy and sugar-coated words...

Then you are wrong!

""Copywriting is the art and science of persuasion""

It's more about understanding customer phycology.

After that, it's just crafting your story and message for your audience that turns ""may-be"" into ""yes""

and that's exactly where I can help you😉.

Whether it's your ads, landing page, emails, sales page, or any other copy...

I can help you to craft them to win your audience's hearts and generate more sales for your business.

(You can check my portfolio - My portfolio is live proof of what I talk about😉)  

So... If you want your copy that, 

- Stand out from your competition and make yourself unique

- Wins your audience's heart and makes them your buyers

- Bring the revenue that your business truly deserves

I am currently a Computer Science Master’s student at Oregon State University in Corvallis, Oregon. Before this, I worked for Accenture and SAP Labs India. My 4.5 years of professional experience encompasses middleware integration development, software quality assurance, and application/customer support including incident management & ticket resolution. 

During my time with SAP Labs, I worked on the BTP platform for the Cloud for Utilities (C4U) portfolio and on SAP's SaaS CRM tool - Cloud for Customer (C4C). Besides this, I completed a host of SAP certifications spanning Intelligent Enterprise, Analytics Cloud, and S/4HANA in an endeavor to cultivate SAP landscape expertise. At Accenture, I garnered experience in software quality assurance and functional knowledge of the Life Sciences, Retail, and Utility domains through global client projects. I also invested time in skilling myself in cloud technologies through Azure and GCP training.

Because of prior and current experiences with CRM applications and customer support, I have developed an immense interest in CRM in general, and Salesforce in particular. I am a Salesforce 'Ranger' scheduled to take my SCA and Platform Developer I exams soon and have also dabbled in ServiceNow.

Beyond work and academia, my ever-evolving interests range from reading, karaoke, playing the piano to studying Sanskrit and the Romance languages.

I bring all these diverse and transferrable skill sets with me that I look forward to employing in my next full-time role. If my skills seem like a good fit with your organization and culture, I welcome you to reach me at mahalea@oregonstate.edu or schedule a call at https://topmate.io/apoorva_mahale and I would be happy to discuss how I could contribute to your firm.

Thanks for stopping by :))

Ever since my childhood (literally, I was 12 years old), I began learning about products. Back then when I needed some extra money to celebrate new year's eve, I applied some spectacular marketing techniques to sell my cartoon arts. For example, say Nobita and Kitretsu). I used to charge 10rs per drawing, and my classmates bought them for like hell!

Obviously, I wanted to have my own ""product"" and so I, along with 3 best friends, successfully created an Instagram motivational quote page, where we bought 500+ followers in a span of fewer than 3 days.

After Instagram banned our account, (a story for another day), I took a break from experimenting, and read books on marketing, self-help, business, and entrepreneurship for 2 years straight!

Fast forward to the second semester of engineering in 2020, COVID-19 hit the shore! All we could see everywhere was Ludo, Dalgona Coffee, and some nuisance facts.

That's when I decided to kick-start my career in PM again. (Yes, I was still in the second semester, but I had that confidence and zest in me to do something bigger in life!).

Started off with internships, my first one paid me 5000 INR. (Yes, it's a small amount but I was on cloud nine back then).

Opportunities kickstarted, and from internships, I moved to freelance when my second year of engineering kicked in. It was 2021, I wanted to get my finances right before I could start experimenting in the field of product - anything and everything for taking it from 0-1!

That's when I started an EdTech Agency and tied up with 2-3 premiere coaching institutions from India. That was my first officially working business model! (All courtesy to Personal MBA by Josh Kaufmann)

In less than a year, my agency banged six-figure revenue. (Yep, I was in my third year of college by now). Alongside my business model, I was exploring fields like project management, marketing, and product management.

And all this, I've been doing part-time along with my full-time college degree in engineering. (Well, I'm pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science, that's what makes me data-driven too - name it HTML, CSS, JS, or CRM tools - I'm a pro in all! - at least that's what my clients and employers say. :))

Apart from that, yes I’m really good at market research, strategizing ideas, product analysis, user experience, agile methodologies - say anything about product - I’m good at it!

Good to know that you aren’t lazy. Give yourself a pat.

Any brand that doesn’t grab people’s attention fast and tell them how desirable their services are with powerful writing will lose it. 

But it won’t be yours, because I will write for you. 

Hi, I am Aman, a freelance copywriter who helps brands capture people’s attention with creative ideas and clear words. 👋


Here is my story -

2018 was the year when I realized that copywriting was my calling. 

It was the last year of college, and I was clueless about what to do after BBA when I participated in an inter-college blog writing competition.

That competition changed everything. I won the 1st prize in it, and suddenly the dots started connecting. 🥇

I understood why I scored excellent in English in school and average in other subjects.

Why I scribbled poems on the back of my notebook, and why I got my first paid writing gig when I was just in high school. ✍️

I loved words; I was good with them, and the world wanted me to write. 

So I skipped my college placements, enrolled in a digital marketing class, and decided to pursue copywriting.

Since then, it's been 4 years of learning, growing, and working as a copywriter and I have helped 25+ brands.


Here are a few of the most exciting projects I worked on - 

👉 Created a series of posts for the pre-launch social media campaign for a new-age fintech app.  

👉 Increased traffic and conversions on an IT company’s website by writing SEO copy and optimizing the layout. 

👉 Helped an e-commerce brand clear its stock by writing a fun weekly newsletter. 

👉 Took a wellness brand’s Twitter following from 0 to 100 in under a month with humorous tweets. 

👉 Increased enrollment in a yoga training program by writing conversion copy for its landing page. 

👉 Wrote pitch decks for startups in Ed-tech, law, taxation, and automobiles to convey their USP to stakeholders. 

I also gained 4,500+ followers on Linkedin in these 4 years and received countless work enquires which I am very grateful for.


If you are looking for a copywriter who can -

🚀 Take your website copy, social media pages, and other marketing materials to the next level with engaging words. 

🤝 Act like an extended member of your team, interpret briefs, and generate ideas quickly. 

 🔊 Give a positive direction to your brand's marketing communication and branding.

Currently, working at Sunfeast Biscuits as a Brand Manager taking ownership of Dark Fantasy sub-brands! 

I am a MBA Graduate from IIM-A & did BCom from SRCC, Delhi University. I started my professional journey with Bira as a Management Trainee, managed Western Karnataka as a Sales Head, worked in Business Strategy till 2020. Pandemic gave me an opportunity to explore a completely new space in the alcoholic beverages industry - to create and launch a marketplace for AlcoBev products. 

From trying to figure out the delivery space in India, I transitioned to Licious in the Marketing team where the entire revenue was coming from online meat delivery! I was involved in the planning & driving of GMV for the platform for all categories at a National level. Having worked in two start-ups, I wanted to get the experience of working at a corporate and thus ITC happened.

You would surely see the inner child in me when we get to talking about Marketing, Advertisements, Startups, Sports & Indian Movies. I also run a Digital Sports Channel being a passionate Sports Fan. Have always liked being in front of the camera and play/ watch sports so trying to be a Content Creator in my free time these days :)",17,9,8,male,1,15
